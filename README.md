**Company Microservice**

-Overview The Company Microservice serves as the central registry for all organizations within the Job Portal ecosystem. It acts as a core data provider and demonstrates Event-Driven Architecture by acting as a Kafka Consumer. It listens for review events to automatically update company ratings in real-time without direct coupling to the review creation process.

**Tech Stack**

* Java 21

* Spring Boot 3.5.7

* Spring Cloud OpenFeign

* Apache Kafka (Consumer)

* MySQL Database

* Micrometer & Zipkin (Distributed Tracing)

* Spring Security (JWT)

**Configuration**
* Port: 8081

* Database: MySQL (companyms_db)

* Application Name: companyms

**Key Features**
* Event-Driven Rating Updates (Kafka Consumer): Listens to the companyRatingQueue topic. When a new review is added in the Review Service, this service consumes the event and updates the company's average rating automatically.

* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Secured with JWT tokens. USER Role: Can view company details, download logos, and search companies. ADMIN Role: Has full access to create, update, and delete companies, as well as upload logos.

* Binary File Handling (Logo Management): Supports uploading and storing company logos directly in the database using @Lob (Large Object) storage. Exposes endpoints to download these images via media type headers.

* Advanced Search and Filtering: Provides rich data retrieval options including Pagination, Sorting by specific fields, Filtering by foundation year, and Keyword Search across name, description, and CEO fields.

* Inter-Service Communication: Uses OpenFeign to communicate synchronously with the Review Service to fetch precise average rating calculations when processing Kafka events.

* Data Integrity Validation: Prevents duplicate entries by validating company names before creation or updates. Ensures that critical operations (like deletions) handle non-existent entities gracefully.
